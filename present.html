                        <strong>Printing Press</strong>:  “Knowledge is power, as the saying goes, and the invention of the mechanical movable type printing press helped disseminate knowledge wider and faster than ever before.”(Roos, 2019)

                        <strong>The Computer</strong>: “Let’s face it, computer technology has fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and play. From the dawn of the first computer systems to the sophisticated AI and IoT (Internet of Things) devices we see today, the field of computer technology continues to push boundaries, setting new standards every year. But what exactly does “computer technology” encompass, and why should it matter to you?”(Logan, 2024)

                        <strong>Transistor</strong>: “What's the most important invention in history? This is a tough question, as there are a lot of really good candidates. Fire, agriculture, writing, and many other discoveries have completely changed human existence. But perhaps the most important invention of the modern era was the transistor. (Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak argued this case in a 2014 column for Popular Mechanics.)”(Thompson, 2016)
